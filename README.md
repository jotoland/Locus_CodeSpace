Code Space for the LOCUS application


LOCUS is an Android smartphone application that uses the Google location services Application Programming Interface (API) and 
Google Firebase database allowing users to create groups and populate said groups with other LOCUS users. 
The application exists in two forms, the application on the userâ€™s Android smartphone and the Google Firebase database which 
houses all the information shared amongst LOCUS users.
